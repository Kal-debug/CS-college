# CS-college 🎓

This repository is a curated collection of some of the interesting and complex programming projects (to me) I've worked on during my college journey.

While originally built for personal growth and reflection, this repo also serves as a glimpse into the technical challenges I've tackled, the languages I’ve explored, and the mindset I’ve cultivated throughout my time in school. You’ll find coursework-based implementations here—from data structures and algorithms to scheduling simulations, compiler design, and UI-driven apps.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

Projects in this repo are written in a variety of languages and environments, including but not limited to:

- **C, C++, Java, Python, Assembly**
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js**

Each language represents a different problem-solving approach, and I enjoy experimenting with switching paradigms, optimizing for performance, or even just building things for the sake of curiosity.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Every project has its own folder with:
- Source code
- A brief `README.md` (when needed) explaining what the project does, how it works, and how to run it

Expect to see a mix of:
- Academic assignments
- Explorations of algorithms or systems topics
- Small experiments with frameworks, tools, or new languages

## 🚧 Work In Progress

This is an **active** and evolving collection. With more semesters to go and new concepts to explore, I’ll continue adding new projects, improving older ones, and restructuring as I go.

## 🧠 Personal Philosophy

> “To learn is to attempt and pursue each and every single project with the intent of going above and beyond, doing all-nighters, trying till the very last second. To learn is to never stop trying.”

Thanks for stopping by. Feel free to look around—each project tells a part of the story.
